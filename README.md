# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code and materials for my thesis on diabetes prediction using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and treatment. In this thesis project, I explore the application of machine learning algorithms to predict the onset of diabetes based on various health-related features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Diabetes prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/). It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.
- `src/`: Source code for implementing machine learning models and preprocessing functions.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project, such as literature reviews, thesis document, and presentations.
